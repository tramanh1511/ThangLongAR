"dest1": "Typical Monuments",
"cotCo1": "Hanoi Flag Tower",
"cotCo2": "The \"Hanoi Flag Tower\" is located on Dien Bien Phu Street, in Ba Dinh District, Hanoi. It was built in 1812, during the reign of King Gia Long of the Nguyen Dynasty, on the southern part of the land of the Thang Long Imperial Citadel, where the Tam Mon Gate of the Thang Long Imperial Citadel was built during the time of the Le Dynasty.\n\nThis tower serves as a landmark, marking the beginning at the southern end of the central axis of the citadel, from here along the \"fish tail\" path, through the Doan Mon Gate, to the most important point, the central point of the citadel which is Kinh Thien Palace.\n\nThe Hanoi Flag Tower is now the most intact and magnificent structure within the complex of the Thang Long Imperial Citadel.\n\nThe Flag Tower is constructed with three pedestal layers and a column shaft. The pedestal layers are in the shape of truncated square pyramids, diminishing in size and stacked on top of each other, surrounded by brick cladding. The first layer is 42.5 meters long, 3.1 meters high, with two brick staircases leading up.\n\nThe second layer is 27 meters long, 3.7 meters high, with 4 doors. The east-facing door is inscribed with the words \"Nghenh Huc\" (welcoming the morning light), the west-facing door with the words \"Hoi Quang\" (reflecting light), the south-facing door with the words \"Huong Minh\" (facing the light), and the north-facing door without an inscription.\n\nThe third layer is 12.8 meters long, 5.1 meters high, with a door leading to the observation bridge facing north. On this layer is the column shaft, 18.2 meters high, octagonal in shape, tapering upwards, with each base side about 2 meters. Inside the shaft is a spiral staircase of 54 steps leading to the top.\n\nThe entire structure is illuminated (and ventilated) by 39 fan-shaped openings. The top of the Flag Tower consists of an octagonal pavilion, 3.3 meters high, with 8 windows corresponding to the eight sides. In the middle of the pavilion is a cylindrical column, 40cm in diameter, extending to the top of the pavilion, where the flagpole (8 meters high) is inserted.\n\nThe entire Flag Tower is 33.4 meters high, and if the flagpole is included, it reaches 41.4 meters.\n\nThe Hanoi Flag Tower is one of the few architectural works in the Hanoi Citadel area that escaped destruction by the French colonial authorities during the years 1894-1897.\n\nOn October 10, 1954, for the first time, the red flag with a yellow star - the national flag - was raised on the top of the Hanoi Flag Tower and was recognized as a historical monument in 1989.\n\nOn October 10, 1954, Hanoi celebrated the great victory, the day of liberation. The whole city gathered at the Hanoi Flag Tower to witness the historic moment: the flag-raising ceremony of the national flag on the top of the Hanoi Flag Tower.\n\nAt exactly 3 p.m. on October 10, 1954, the horn of the City Theater sounded. The military band followed the direction of Comrade Dinh Ngoc Lien, pulling up the national flag according to the military march rhythm. For the first time, the red flag with a yellow star - the national flag - flew on the top of the Hanoi Flag Tower.\n\nFrom the time of its construction to the present day, the Hanoi Flag Tower has been nearly two hundred years old. When the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was established, the image of the Hanoi Flag Tower was solemnly printed on the first banknotes issued by the State Bank of Vietnam.\n\nFor over half a century, atop the Hanoi Flag Tower, the red flag with five-pointed yellow star flies proudly against the sky of the Thousand-Year-Old Capital Hanoi, forever a symbol of glory and pride of the independent and free Vietnamese nation.\n\nAccording to research documents, since 1986, a red flag with a yellow star measuring 24 square meters has always flown atop the Hanoi Flag Tower.\n\nToday, the Hanoi Flag Tower is located on Dien Bien Phu Street, surrounded by ancient banyan trees and at its foot is a lush lychee garden.\n\nAccording to some research documents, in a photo taken in 1890 by Louis Sadoul, a French military doctor, the area of the Lenin Statue Flower Garden at the foot of the current flagpole was once a pond for bathing elephants of the Nguyen Dynasty court. The ancient banyan trees seen today were not yet planted at that time. In the photo, it can also be seen that the French army built a solid camp on the terraces of the Flag Tower to station troops.\n\nDuring this period, the Hanoi Flag Tower was also used by the French army as an observation post. During the destructive war waged by the United States, the Flag Tower was also used as an observation post by the Hanoi air defense forces. At that time, from the top of the Flag Tower, one could see both Hanoi and the suburban areas.\n\nWhat is especially remarkable is that even during the hottest days in Hanoi, the temperature inside the Flag Tower remains cool as if it has air conditioning. The structure of the ascending and descending doors of the Flag Tower is also so scientific that no matter how heavy the rain is, water does not flow into the tower.",

"doanMon1": "The main gate (Doan Mon)",
"doanMon2": "Doan Mon is one of the main gates leading into the Forbidden City. Based on the building materials and remaining architectural style of the relic, it can be confirmed that Doan Mon was built during the Lê Dynasty and renovated during the Nguyen Dynasty. The relic is located to the south of Kinh Thien Palace, directly aligned with the Flag Tower of Hanoi. Doan Mon is constructed horizontally in a U-shaped structure. It follows the architectural style of ancient city walls, with five gates built with nearly symmetrical vaulted arches across the 'divine axis,' also known as the 'central axis' of the Imperial Citadel. The main architectural feature is in the style of a watchtower, with three arched doors. The vaulted arch architecture of the city gates not only provides graceful curves but also has an exceptionally strong load-bearing structure. Even to this day, the most modern and grand underground structures in the world still use this architectural style. The main materials used are brick, a common type of brick from the Lê Dynasty, and stone for the gate's vault. From east to west, it is 47.5m long; from south to north, the middle section measures 13m, and the two side wings are 26.5m long and 6m high. The central gate, reserved for the king, is 4m high and 2.7m wide. On either side are four smaller doors, each 3.8m high and 2.5m wide, used by officials and princes to enter and exit the Forbidden City whenever there were royal decrees or to participate in major ceremonies at Kinh Thien Palace conducted by the Emperor. A stone plaque engraved with the words 'Doan Mon' is affixed above the main gate, measuring 1.5m long and 0.7m wide. There are small brick steps on both sides leading to the second floor. This floor corresponds to the area of the central main gate. Due to renovations for military purposes, the original architecture has not been fully studied. On the roof of the second floor is a small two-story octagonal pavilion. The tiled roof is adorned with two dragon heads (at the ends), with a tiger relief in the middle; the four corners of the roof form curved blades. In 1999, archaeologists excavated a pit right in the middle of the current Doan Mon gate to search for traces of the ancient Imperial Road. At a depth of 1.2m, the stone border of the Doan Mon wall footing and a stone-paved courtyard from the Lê Dynasty were uncovered. At a depth of 1.9m, traces of a 'lotus flower' tiled road from the Tran Dynasty were found. Heading southeast, it is predicted that the road extends further and is likely the path from Doan Mon to the Thiên An Palace during the Tran Dynasty. Notably, among the Tran Dynasty tiled road bricks, there are reused bricks from the Ly Dynasty. Thus, the archaeological results at Doan Mon further reinforce the hypothesis that Doan Mon during the Ly, Tran, and Lê Dynasties was essentially located in the same position.'",

"kinhThien1": "Kinh Thien Palace" ,
"kinhThien2": "This is the central relic, among the overall relics of the Central Imperial Citadel of Thang Long - Hanoi. Kinh Thien Palace - the most important palace, where the most solemn ceremonies of the royal court are held, where foreign emissaries are welcomed and where important national affairs are held in court. '\nAccording to \"Dai Viet Su Ky Toan Thu\", Kinh Thien Palace was built in 1428 during the reign of King Le Thai To and completed during the reign of King Le Thanh Tong. Kinh Thien Palace was built on Nung Mountain, right on the old foundation of Can Nguyen - Thien An palace during the Ly and Tran dynasties.\nNaming the adoration hall after Can Nguyen, Ly Thai To chose the right center of heaven and earth to place his throne to rule the country. After the Ly dynasty kings, the Tran and Le dynasties built a rampart system here. The important area is Cam Thanh (or Long Thanh, Long Phuong Thanh) in Thang Long citadel during the Ly - Tran - Le dynasties. The center is Can Nguyen palace, Thien An palace under Ly - Tran dynasty, Kinh Thien palace under Le dynasty.\nSince 1788, when King Quang Trung established his capital in Phu Xuan - Hue and then the Nguyen Dynasty (1802 - 1945) also established its capital here, Thang Long citadel became the headquarters of Tran Bac Thanh.\nIn 1805, King Gia Long built this area as a palace for the king to use whenever the Nguyen kings \"came to the North\". The name \"Hanoi Citadel\" appeared in 1831, when King Minh Mang carried out a major administrative reform, establishing provinces across the country, including Hanoi province. Hanoi Citadel is the headquarters of Hanoi province. Noi.\nDuring the French colonial period, at the end of the 19th century, the French colonialists demolished Kinh Thien palace and built an artillery command headquarters here. This house is called the Dragon house (also known as Long Tri), because there are stone dragons flanking it in front and back.\nAfter October 10, 1954, when our troops took over the capital, this area became the workplace of the Ministry of National Defense.\nIn 2004, the Ministry of National Defense handed over a part of the central area (central axis) of Thang Long - Hanoi Citadel to the Hanoi People's Committee for management.\nArchitecture\nKinh Thien Palace is a central relic, the main nucleus in the overall historical sites of Hanoi Ancient Citadel. In front of Kinh Thien Palace is Doan Mon, then Hanoi Flagpole, behind is Hau Lau, Bac Gate, the east and west sides have walls and small doors. These gates have been classified by the French protectorate since 1925 along with a number of other relics in the ancient citadel.\nKinh Thien Palace is the central building of the royal palace during the Le Dynasty (15th - 18th centuries) in Thang Long - Dong Kinh (Hanoi). In 1428, after the victory over the Ming army, Le Thai To continued to base his capital in Thang Long, building and repairing the damaged royal citadel. Kinh Thien Palace was built during this period. By 1886, the palace was destroyed, only the ruins of the steps and palace foundation remain (in today's Hanoi Ancient Citadel).\nObserving the architecture of Kinh Thien Palace through photos taken by the French in the late 19th century, we can see that Kinh Thien Palace is a wooden structure consisting of two folds shaped like the letter Nhi (二). The house is made of a 2-storey, 8-roof matchbox style with curved corners. The roofs of both houses are embossed with a pair of dragons flanking the sun. Around the palace there is a large yard with railings on all four sides.\nThe remains of Kinh Thien Palace today are only the old foundation. The palace's foundation is 57m long, 41.5m wide, 2.3m high and the steps are built of green stone forming three entrances. On the south side of the palace, there is also a railing over 100 cm high. The front, main south direction of Kinh Thien Palace is a terrace built of large stone slabs consisting of 10 steps with 4 stone dragons divided into 3 equal paths, forming the Dragon Shelf. The steps have dimensions: 13.7 m horizontal, 4.45 m vertical, 2.1 m high with a pair of stone dragons carved in 1467 which are relatively intact stone sculptures.The Stone Dragon of Kinh Thien Palace is a masterpiece of architectural and artistic heritage, typical of the sculpture art of the Early Le Dynasty. Carved from green stone, the stone dragon has a raised head, a large head, round and bulging eyes, long horns with branches, and a mane that curves back. The dragon's body curves softly into many arcs, gradually getting smaller towards the temple floor. On its back is a long fin that undulates like clouds and sparks.On the north side of Kinh Thien Palace's foundation, there is also a 7-step platform that is smaller than the main platform on the south side. On both sides of the steps there are 2 stone dragons dating back to Le Trung Hung (17th-18th centuries), 3.4m long dragons; 7 bends, scaly body, back like a row of fish fins, 5 clawed dragon feet... Both sides of the railing are decorated with lotus flowers, water waves, swords, fire, clouds...\nThe foundation and steps of the palace are the few relics of the royal palace architecture of the Le Dynasty that remain today, partly reflecting the majestic scale of the ancient Kinh Thien Palace.Today, this space has become a \"dual\" monument for both eras: Kinh Thien Palace of the ancient Thang Long Imperial Citadel and the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army - an important historical relic of the modern history of Vietnam.'",

"bacMon1": "Northern gate (Bac Mon)",
"bacMon2": "Bac Mon (North Gate), built by the Nguyen Dynasty in 1805 on the foundation of the Lê Dynasty's North Gate, follows the style of a watchtower – the upper part is a floor while the lower part is a fortress, standing 8.71m tall, 17.08m wide, with walls 20.48m thick. The upper floor is constructed with wooden frames in a traditional eight-panel roof style, covered with red tiles and featuring doors opening in all four directions. Rainwater on the watchtower is drained down through two stone gutters. Standing on the city gate, military commanders could oversee the entire interior and exterior of the citadel, easily observing any movements or changes in the enemy's formations. Therefore, even after capturing Hanoi, the French military continued to use the upper floor of Bac Mon as a guard post. Today, the upper floor of the city gate has been partially restored and dedicated as a place of worship for two notable governors of Hanoi – Nguyen Tri Phuong and Hoang Dieu - who sacrificed themselves due to the inability to defend the citadel against the firepower of the French army. Many people still regularly climb Bac Mon watchtower to light incense and pay homage to these brave heroes – individuals so revered that modern-day streets running alongside the ancient citadel are named after them. The fortress was built solidly with stone and brick, with stone foundations and a brick vaulted gate created by alternating horizontal and vertical bricks. The bricks used in the construction were 35.5cm x 10cm x 12cm in size, while the supporting stones ranged in length from 38 to 86cm. The rectangular-shaped stone doorframe was adorned with lotus motifs. The two wooden gate wings have been renovated, with a total area of 24m² and a weight of around 16 tons, running on copper wheels weighing approximately 80kg each. On the outer side above the city gate are three Han Chinese characters carved in stone: 'Chinh Bac Mon' with decorative floral patterns. According to historical records and photographic evidence from the time of Hanoi's citadel, the two sides of Bac Mon inside the city walls feature triangular-shaped staircases leading up to the watchtower. In front of Bac Mon is a brick bridge spanning a moat approximately 20m wide that encircles the citadel. Observers can easily see that the area currently occupied by the moat in front of Bac Mon is now a grassy area, sidewalk, and part of Phan Dinh Phung street. Some argue that the sturdy brick bridge leading to Bac Mon is not a drawbridge, so the moat does not serve a defensive purpose. However, others believe that while the entrance to the citadel is not a drawbridge, the defensive goal of the moat surrounding the ancient citadel is crucial – it helps limit enemy access to the citadel's base. Although Bac Mon was built by the Nguyen Dynasty, beneath this imposing city gate lie layers of relics from previous dynasties, affirming the continuous historical significance of the Imperial Citadel over thousands of years. In 1998, archaeologists discovered numerous architectural traces at Bac Mon at depths of 1.66m and 2.2m, including remnants of stone and brick walls dating back to the Lê Dynasty. Today, Bac Mon has become a popular destination for both domestic and international tourists. If one pays attention, they can easily notice two scars outside Bac Mon left by French cannonballs when they used warships to attack Hanoi from the Red River. When breaching the ancient walls of Hanoi, the French colonialists deliberately spared Bac Mon, both to serve as a lookout post and to boast about their \"achievements\" in capturing the capital. Recently, during the renovation of Bac Mon by Hanoi authorities, these two battle scars were deliberately preserved as a reminder of a time when Hanoi suffered under the boots of foreign invaders, and the brave people of Hanoi valiantly resisted the foreign aggressors.",


"khaoCo1": "Archaeological sites" ,
"khaoCo2": "The archaeological relic site at 18 Hoang Dieu is located about 100m west of Kinh Thien Palace, in the unified whole of the heritage of the Central Citadel of Thang Long - Hanoi.\nSince December 2002, the largest archaeological excavation in Vietnam has been carried out at 18 Hoang Dieu. The archaeological excavation area is divided into 4 zones by the Institute of Archeology, named A, B, C, D. Important discoveries of underground archeology in the western area of ​​the central axis of the Forbidden City at 18 Hoang Dieu has revealed a complex of rich and diverse architectural relics with millions of relics from many periods stacked and interwoven, starting from the Dai La period (7th-9th centuries), Dinh, Early Le (10th century), Ly Dynasty (1009-1225), Tran (1226-1400), Le So (1428-1527), Mac (1527- 1592), Le Trung Hung (1593- 1789) and Nguyen (1802- 1945).\nThe bottom layer is the architectural system of the Pre-Thang Long period, also known as the An Nam colonial period or Dai La, clearly shown through the system of wooden columns, architectural foundations, drainage pipes, and wells. water and relics such as \"Jiangxi Quan\" bricks, tube tiles decorated with images of divine animals, clown faces and many ceramics dating from the 7th - 9th centuries. '\nThe upper layer of the architecture of the Dai La period is the architectural trace of the Ly - Tran dynasties, clearly shown through the architectural plan system with gravel foundation pillars, brick foundations, lotus stone bases, brick courtyards, Sewer lines, especially decorative relics on architectural roofs, are large in size and elaborately decorated. Some locations have cultural vestiges of the Dinh - Early Le period.\nAt the top is the architectural layer of the Le Dynasty, with traces of architectural foundations built of bricks, water well systems, especially the types of lapis lazuli and lapis lazuli tiles decorated with 5-claw dragons specifically used for roofing. on the roof of the king's palace and all kinds of porcelain used exclusively for the king. Some locations have cultural vestiges of the Nguyen Dynasty but they are faint and unclear.\nThe soil layers bear the mark of all historical periods within the past 1,300 years, but have an orderly and continuous evolution, especially located in the center of the Imperial Citadel and the Forbidden Citadel of Thang Long. Long. This area is an invaluable asset of Vietnamese history and culture in general, and of the history and culture of Thang Long - Hanoi in particular.\nAs of December 2009, in a total excavation area of ​​33,000 square meters, archaeologists have initially identified 168 relics including: 95 traces of architectural foundations, 16 relics of boundary wall foundations, 24 wells. water and 33 sewers.\nBesides architectural vestiges, there are traces of ponds, lakes, and streams, especially a river dug in the Early Le Dynasty with wooden boats, oars, and red-painted rudders. Remains of the lotus lake of the Forbidden City were also identified through the remains of leaves and lotus roots in the mud layer of the lake. That is the image of harmonious cohesion in urban planning, creating the environmental landscape of ancient Thang Long.\nThe relic site has revealed millions of relics, of which a large number are architectural materials, ceramics and metal objects. Many artifacts are belongings of the Emperor and the Royal Family, associated with Imperial life and bearing the influence of Buddhism and Confucianism. Many ceramic artifacts have very diverse origins, not only produced by Vietnamese people but also purchased from China, Japan and West Asia. This shows that in Thang Long - Hanoi, cultural exchange and interference have taken place on a fairly wide scale.\nAlthough the complex of architectural foundation vestiges discovered at 18 Hoang Dieu is no longer intact, it is authentic and has very high scientific value, along with millions of relics discovered, reflecting the connection between the two buildings. The continuity of the long historical process of thousands of years of a center of power, demonstrating the cultural interference and integration with countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia of Thang Long - Hanoi, creating Dai Viet culture is imbued with national identity.",

The main reason is because the project is built with sustainable materials: iron, steel, bricks, sand, cement. When damage occurs, the project is repaired promptly, on the other hand, the project is located in the construction area. Confidential area, carefully protected.\nOn the outside, House D67 is a normal flat-roof house, size: 43.02 x 20.85m, roof top height 7.89m, located under a grove of trees.
